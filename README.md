Hotel Booking Chatbot
A conversational AI assistant designed to streamline the hotel booking process. This chatbot allows users to search for hotels, check availability, get information about amenities, and make reservations directly through a chat interface. It leverages natural language processing to understand user queries and provides a user-friendly experience, eliminating the need to navigate complex booking websites. The project is built using Next.js for the frontend and Firebase for the backend, with Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive styling.
