Analyze the user's request for details like city, price (e.g., "cheap," "luxury"), desired rating ("high-rated," "best"), and specific amenities or features (e.g., "swimming pool," "near the beach," "sea view").

Based on the following user preferences:
"{{{preferences}}}"

And the available hotel data:
"{{{hotelData}}}"

Recommend up to 3 hotels that are the best fit. For each recommendation, provide the hotel_id and a brief, compelling reason explaining why it matches their request.

Example Response Format:
[
    {
        "hotel_id": "HTL002",
        "reason": "This luxurious beachfront hotel has stunning sea views and a pool, matching your request perfectly."
